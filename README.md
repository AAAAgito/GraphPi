# GraphPi

GraphPi is being refactored. The official version will be released in the final version of our paper.



## How to run on a single machine

In this section, you will learn how to run GraphPi on a single machine with multi threads (using OpenMP).



### Step 0 : Load the dataset

The class `DataLoader` is used to load the dataset.  And the dataset will store in class `Graph` .

The format of the dataset may be a little different from its download version. The first line should contain two integers: the number of vertices and the number of edges respectively. From the second line, each line contains two integers `x`and ` y`,representing a directed edge `(x,y)` in the graph. Since GraphPi's performance model needs the number of triangles in the dataset, a constant variable named `dataset_tri_cnt` is needed in `include/dataloader.h`(See our code for more detail).

We have already prepared these classical datasets for GraphPi: `Patents` ,`Orkut` ,`LiveJournal`, `MiCo`, `Twitter`, `CiteSeer` and `WikiVote` . We only upload `WikiVote` dataset to github as an example, because some datasets are very large.

When the dataset is prepared, we can load the dataset easily. First,  you need to define a pointer of a graph and a dataloader.

```cpp
Graph *g;
Dataloader D;
```

Then, you need to use `std::string` to assign the dataset's name and file path.

```cpp
const std::string type_str = "Wiki-Vote";
const std::string path = "./datasets/wiki-vote_input"
```

In `include/common.h`, we provide many functions to make your coding more easy. Using `GetDataType` to transform `std::string` to `DataType`.

```cpp
DataType my_type;
GetDataType(my_type, type_str);
```

Now you can load the dataset using the function `load_data()`. If it failed to load the dataset, this function returns `false`.

```cpp
assert(D.load_data(g,my_type,path.c_str()));
```

After steps above, you have a graph `g` which contains the Wiki-Vote dataset.

### Step 1 : Define the pattern

The class `Pattern` is used to store the pattern. There are several ways to define a pattern.

Taking rectangle as an example, three ways are enabled to define the pattern.

The first one is adding edges yourself.

```
int size = 4;
Pattern p(size);
p.add_edge(0,1);
p.add_edge(1,2);
p.add_edge(2,3);
p.add_edge(3,0);
// the pattern rectangle is like :
// 0 -- 1
// |    |
// 3 -- 2
```

Since the rectangle pattern is used frequently, we provide an easier way for you to load the rectangle. 

```
Pattern p(PatternType::Rectangle);
```

And the third way is a little bit brute-force, you can provide adjoint matrix as a char array.

```cpp
int size = 4;
char adj_mat[17] = "0101101001011010"; // the vertex 0 has neighbor 1 and 3, so the first four character "0101" means 0 have edges to 1 and 3 but not have an edge to 0 or 2.
Pattern p(size, adj_mat);
```

### Step 2 : Define the schedule

Three things you need to decide in this step : 1) performance modeling type 2) restrictions type 3) the use of inclusion-exclusion optimization.

In class `Schedule` you can see the constructor function :

```cpp
 Schedule(const Pattern& pattern, bool& is_pattern_valid, int performance_modeling_type, int restricts_type, bool use_in_exclusion_optimize, int v_cnt, unsigned int e_cnt, long long tri_cnt);
```

For `performance_modeling_type`, 0 means not t use performance modeling; 1 means to use GraphPi's performance modeling.

For `restricts_type`, 0 means not to use restricts; 1 means using GraphPi's restriction generator.

`v_cnt`, `e_cnt` and `tri_cnt`  mean the number of vertices, edges and triangles of the input graph respectively.

And you need to use variable `pattern` defined in the step 1.



So if we want to use GraphPi's performance model and restrictions without inclusion-exclusion optimization, you should run like this :

```cpp
int performance_modeling_type = 1;
int restricts_type = 1;
bool use_in_exclusion_optimize = false;
bool is_pattern_valid;

Schedule schedule(pattern, is_pattern_valid, performance_modeling_type, restricts_type, use_in_exclusion_optimize, g->v_cnt, g->e_cnt, g->tri_cnt);
assert(is_pattern_valid);
```



### Step 3 : Run pattern matching

GraphPi is based on OpenMP to enable multi-threads, so you need to decide how many threads to use in the process of pattern matching. In our experiment, we use 24 threads.

```
int thread_num = 24;
```

Now, we can run the member function `pattern_matching` of the class `Graph`.

```
long long ans = g->pattern_matching(schedule, thread_num);
```

And the result is stored in the variable `ans`ï¼ˆshort for answer).



### Hint

If you are still confused, you can see `tianhe/baseline_test.cpp` as an example. This program is following steps above.

Many functions are implemented for debugging and experiments, you can just ignore them.

## How to run the distributed version
GraphPi uses MPI to implement the distributed version.

You can see `src/run_mpi_trivial.cpp` as an example.

The parameters used in the distributed version are the same as those used in the single node version. You can choose to pass parameters through the command line or modify them directly in `src/run_mpi_trivial.cpp`.
